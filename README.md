Welcome to the Tesla Stock Prediction p roject! In this project, we focus on predicting Tesla's stock prices using time-series data. We employ a combination of Python programming, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning techniques including LSTM and RNN.

## Project Overview

This project's goal is to create accurate predictions for Tesla's stock prices by leveraging historical time-series data. We utilize both traditional Machine Learning methods and advanced Deep Learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

## Technologies Used

- Python programming
- Machine Learning libraries
- Deep Learning libraries (LSTM, RNN)
- Time-series data analysis
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

## Project Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into the data distribution, trends, and patterns.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - Utilize the Slicing Windowing method to preprocess the data for time-series analysis.
   - Prepare the dataset by creating input sequences and corresponding target values.

3. **Build Model:**
   - Develop a predictive model architecture suitable for time-series forecasting.
   - Consider employing techniques like LSTM and RNN that are well-suited for sequential data.

4. **Training Model:**
   - Train the model on the preprocessed data.
   - Utilize appropriate training techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam optimization.

5. **Evaluation and Visualization:**
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance using evaluation metrics like RMSE, MAE, etc.
   - Visualize the predicted stock prices alongside the actual values to assess model accuracy.

6. **Fine-tuning and Optimization:**
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
   - Experiment with different model architectures and parameters to achieve better predictions.

7. **Conclusion and Future Work:**
   - Summarize the project's outcomes and discuss its limitations and potential improvements.
